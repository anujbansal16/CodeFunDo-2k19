## Problem statement

The gold standard for an election is one that is end-to-end (E2E) verifiable.

E2E verifiable elections have three primary components:
1. Voters are assured that their choices are properly recorded.
2. All voters can verify that their vote was counted in the official results.
3. The public can verify that the results of the election are accurate.


Today there is no way through through which the voters can ensure that their votes are accurately recorded and is counted.

## Solution - Post-election audits on the blockchain
  
1. With a PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN, each voter would be allowed to audit each ballot to confirm that reported vote totals are  accurate, without revealing the identity or vote choice of each voter (anonymously).

2. Voters cast ballots and receive QR codes tied to their vote.

3. By scanning the QR code with another device, voters can reassure themselves that their vote was properly recorded. 

The system does not let voters know with certainty that their vote was part of the final election result, but no form of voting currently in use offers that level of assurance.
